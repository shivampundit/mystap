                                your computer or mobile device when you visit a site and allow a site to recognize your

                                from third parties are called “third party cookies” as explained below.

                            <p>Cookies do a lot of different jobs, such as letting you navigate between pages
                                efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving the user experience.
                                They can also help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to
                                you and your interests. In addition, cookies can help us to analyze the use of our
                                websites and online content (analytics cookies) and they can also facilitate/track the
                                interaction on our websites and online content with social media (e.g. links to social
                                media sites, like buttons, etc.).

                            <p>
                                We may also use web beacons (including conversion pixels) or other technologies for
                                similar purposes as above and we may include these on our sites, in marketing e-mail
                                messages or our newsletter, affiliated websites, to determine whether messages have been
                                opened and links clicked on. Web beacons do not place information on your device, but
                                they may work in conjunction with cookies to monitor website activity. The information
                                provided below about cookies also applies to web beacons and similar technologies.
                                Conversion pixels are small codes located on a particular web page which are triggered
                                when someone visits a page resulting in an increase in the conversion count.

                            <p>
                                These cookies allow a site to remember choices you make (such as your username, language
                                or the region you are in) and provide more enhanced, personal features.

                                Advertising and social media cookies (including web beacons and other tracking and
                                storage technologies) are used to (1) deliver advertisements more relevant to you and
                                your interests; (2) limit the number of times you see an advertisement; (3) help measure
                                the effectiveness of the advertising campaign; (4) retargeting to iDesign
                                websites/information and (5) understand people’s behavior after they view an
                                advertisement. They are usually placed on behalf of advertising networks with the site
                                operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a site and quite often they
                                will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. This may impact
                                the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.
