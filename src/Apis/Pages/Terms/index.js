                                third parties (&ldquo;Products&rdquo;) through the Services. The information provided
                                for any Product listing is provided by iDesign's third-party vendors, and, while we
                                require vendors to provide complete, accurate and non-misleading Product information, we
                                do not represent, warrant or guarantee that such Product descriptions are accurate,

                                any liability arising from or relating to, such Product listing information. All

                                only facilitates the transaction between you and the vendor by providing a marketplace
                                for the marketing, offering and sale of Products. Payments for Products transacted
                                through the Service will be remitted to the vendor, and the vendor will be solely
                                responsible for fulfilling and shipping your order, providing related customer support
                                and warranty service and processing returns and exchanges. The Services will facilitate
                                your communication with the vendor for the purpose of making return, exchange or
                                warranty requests or making claims for non-delivery, damaged goods or items not as
                                described in accordance with any applicable terms or policies in the Product listing. In
                                addition, the Services may alert you to any Product issues or recalls of which the
                                vendor notifies iDesign. iDesign does not provide any warranty on any of the Products,
                                whether express or implied, and does not assume, and hereby disclaims, any
                                responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of the third-party vendors of
