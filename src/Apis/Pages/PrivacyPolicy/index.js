                            <p>
                                We use information that we gather from you in the following ways:
                            </p>
                            <p>To provide services and materials through our Website<br/>
                                To deliver information to you about the products, services, and materials provided
                                through our Website<br/>
                                To fulfill our contractual obligations to you as part of any transaction or order
                                involving our products, services, and/or materials<br/>
                                To contact you about our products, services, and Website<br/>
                                In additional manners that we may describe to you when you provide information to us or
                                when we notify you about new uses of information provided by you<br/>
                                By visiting our website, providing us your e-mail address, signing up for our newsletter, registering for an
                                account, ordering products or services from us, or otherwise providing your personal information to us, as set
                                forth above (under Collection of Information), you are consenting to receive communications from us regarding
                                our services and materials.<br/>
                                If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from iDesign, you can choose to opt out at any time.
                                The easiest way to opt out is by sending a SMS “STOP” to +91-9289347893<br/><br/>

                                There are also various other ways to opt out:<br/>

                                Contact our customer services team support@idesign.market<br />
                                Click the link at the end of a marketing email, text or picture message to unsubscribe from that channel<br />
                                Tell the adviser if you receive a marketing call<br />
                                Disable push notification messages, including marketing messages, at any time in our apps by changing the<br />
                                notification settings on your device or by uninstalling the app<br />
                                You may have received marketing from iDesign even if you&rsquo;re not a customer or have never had contact with us.<br />
                                This is a result of third-party marketing lists which iDesign may acquire from time to time, stating that you have<br />
                                given permission to be contacted by other organisations. If you&rsquo;ve registered with us to opt out of marketing<br />
                                from iDesign, you shouldn&rsquo;t receive such communications. If you still do, we ask that you let us know<br />
                                immediately by contacting us at support@idesign.market This will only stop marketing from us and not stop the<br />
                                third parties from sharing your data unless you contact them directly.

                            </p>

                                We will share information provided by you to third parties only in the ways that are
                                described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise disseminate

                                We use a third-party vendor to help us communicate with you via e-mail. Our current
                                vendor is xyz. A description of xyz's services may be found at https://www.xyz.com. We
                                will update this policy in the event we change our communications vendor. We transmit
                                credit card and other payment data through the appropriate credit card company and/or
                                credit card payment processing company or financial institutions to confirm payment for
                                products or services purchased on our Website.
                                If necessary for the provision of our services, we may disclose information (such as
                                name and contact information) to our instructors or other providers of our services.
                                We will disclose information gathered from you or provided by you if we are required to
                                do so by law or legal process or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, or
                                if we need to do so to protect our rights, reputation, property, or the safety of us or
                                others, or to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations.
                                We will disclose information to third parties with your prior consent.
                                Not all of the information we collect may be personally identifiable. We do, however,

                            <h3>Deleting of Information</h3>
                            <p>You may ask us to delete some or all of the information you shared with us, provided,
                                however, that we are not required to maintain that information as part of any commercial
                                transaction or contract entered into between us. For example, we may need to maintain
                                records of credit card transactions or products or services purchased by you from us for
                                a period of time in the event any dispute or other occasion arises whereby that
                                information may be required by third parties or government entities.<br/>
                                You may request that we delete the information provided by you to us by emailing
                                support@idesign.market.<br/>
                                If you believe that we have inaccurate or incomplete information about you, you may
                                request an update to your information by emailing support@idesign.market.<br/>
                                You may request that we limit the use of your information to only that information
                                required for us to conduct any transactions in which you engage with us. For example,
                                you may request that we discontinue sending e-mails or newsletters to you about upcoming
                                courses or other information regarding our products and services. You may opt-out from
                                these communications by emailing support@idesign.market as well as following the
                                instructions on the communications themselves.<br/>
                                Unless you request that we delete the information provided by you, we will maintain that
                                information for a reasonable period of time in the event that you choose, in the future,
                                to purchase our products or services. For example, you may complete one of our courses,
                                and not find an additional course to be of interest to you at present; however, we may
                                introduce a course in the future in which you may wish to enroll. By maintaining your
                                information, we make the enrollment process easier, as well as allow us to provide a
                                history to you of courses in which you previously enrolled.<br/>
                                To maintain the integrity of our Website and the information you provide to us, we may
                                copy that information to a second information storage device (AKA back-up). In the event
                                that you request that we delete your information, we will also delete it from our backup
                                data storage to the extent that it is commercially reasonable to do so. Nevertheless, we
                                do not access our backup storage except under circumstances where data from our primary
                                storage has been compromised (such as may occur during power surges or other situations
                                where our primary storage may be damaged).</p>

                                shall use all reasonable endeavors to resolve such Dispute amicably. If the parties are
                                unable to resolve the Dispute amicably within 30 days of the notice of such Dispute,
                                iDesign may elect to resolve any Dispute by binding arbitration in accordance with the
                                provisions of the Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter Act). Such
                                Dispute shall be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated in any
                                arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The Dispute shall be
                                resolved by a sole arbitrator, appointed in accordance with the Act. The seat of the
                                arbitration shall be New Delhi and the language of this arbitration shall be English.
                                Either You or iDesign may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of
                                competent jurisdiction in New Delhi necessary to protect the rights or the property
                                belonging to You or iDesign (or any of our agents, suppliers, and subcontractors),
                                pending the completion of arbitration. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and
                                neither You nor iDesign may disclose the existence, content, or results of any
                                arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcing the
                                arbitration award. All administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided
                                equally between You and iDesign. In all arbitrations, each party will bear the expense
                                of its own lawyers and preparation. This paragraph shall survive termination of this
